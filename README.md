this is a client side android application for speech synthesis , by using a service hosted on a flask server. please refer to my tacotron respository for the server side implementation
### 
## Background
Google published a paper, [Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10135.pdf),
where they present a neural text-to-speech model that learns to synthesize speech directly from
(text, audio) pairs. keith Ito attempt to provide an open-source implementation of the model described in their paper.

The quality isn't as good as Google's demo yet, but hopefully it will get there someday :-).
Pull requests are welcome!" 

this android application connects to the service hosted on flask server and synthesises the speech. all computations and inference
is made on the computer.
